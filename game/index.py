# changed game_clock attribute of Game class to int type (seconds)
# changed game_engine.reset_clock() to set game_clock to 720 (12 minutes)
# changed game_engine.run_clock() to reduce game_clock by seconds (not timedelta)

# changed get_best_at_position() to filter out injured players
# changed get_best_at_position() during subs using bench_time stat
# updated update_mp(): it now updates bench_time for players on the bench
# cleared bench_time stat for players subbing in
# got teams' tallest players on jump ball
# prevented injured players from subbing in
# prevented free throw shooters from subbing out

# to-do (game_engine):
# 2. composite ratings - almost DONE
# 3. right now, g.assist_man (DONE) and g.shot_taker are random players - fix this
# 4. turnovers are also random - fix this
