Welcome to the "Make or Miss" basketball simulation project repository. This simulation aims to provide a detailed basketball gaming experience with various game mechanics, team management, and player interactions. Below is an overview of the project structure and key components.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several directories:

- `game/`: Contains the core game engine and related utilities.
- `team/`: Includes team-related functionality and data.
- `player/`: Manages player attributes, ratings, and statistics.
- `scripts/`: Holds additional scripts or data related to the game.
- `static/`: Contains static files like stylesheets.
- `templates/`: Includes HTML templates for rendering game views.
- `util/`: Contains utility modules for various project aspects.
- `views/`: Includes HTML views for the web interface.
